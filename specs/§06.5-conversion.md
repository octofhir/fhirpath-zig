### Conversion

The functions in this section operate on collections with a single item. If there is more than one item, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

Note that although all functions return collections, if a given function is defined to return a single element, the return type in the description of the function is simplified to just the type of the single element, rather than the list type.

The following table lists the possible conversions supported, and whether the conversion is implicit or explicit:

| From\To    | Boolean  | Integer   | Decimal   | Quantity  | String    | Date      | DateTime  | Time      |
|------------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Boolean**   | N/A      | Explicit  | Explicit  | -         | Explicit  | -         | -         | -         |
| **Integer**   | Explicit | N/A       | Implicit  | Implicit  | Explicit  | -         | -         | -         |
| **Decimal**   | Explicit | -         | N/A       | Implicit  | Explicit  | -         | -         | -         |
| **Quantity**  | -        | -         | -         | N/A       | Explicit  | -         | -         | -         |
| **String**    | Explicit | Explicit  | Explicit  | Explicit  | N/A       | Explicit  | Explicit  | Explicit  |
| **Date**      | -        | -         | -         | -         | Explicit  | N/A       | Implicit  | -         |
| **DateTime**  | -        | -         | -         | -         | Explicit  | Explicit  | N/A       | -         |
| **Time**      | -        | -         | -         | -         | Explicit  | -         | -         | N/A       |

Implicit conversion is performed when an operator or function is used with a compatible type. For example:

```
5 + 10.0
```

In the above expression, the addition operator expects either two Integers, or two Decimals, so implicit conversion is used to convert the integer to a decimal, resulting in decimal addition.

To use these functions over a collection with multiple items, one may use filters like `where()` and `select()`:

```
Patient.name.given.select(substring(0))
```

This example returns a collection containing the first character of all the given names for a patient.

#### iif(criterion: expression, true-result: collection [, otherwise-result: collection]) : collection

If `criterion` is true, the function returns the value of `true-result` parameter.

If `criterion` is `false` or an empty collection, the function returns `otherwise-result`, unless the optional `otherwise-result` is not given, in which case the function returns an empty collection.

Note that short-circuit behavior is expected in this function. In other words, `true-result` should only be evaluated if the `criterion` evaluates to true, and `otherwise-result` should only be evaluated otherwise. For implementations, this means delaying evaluation of the arguments.

#### convertsToBoolean() : Boolean

If the input collection contains a single item, this function will return true if:

* the item is a Boolean
* the item is an Integer and is convertible to a Boolean using one of the possible integer representations of Boolean values
* the item is a Decimal and is convertible to a Boolean using one of the possible decimal representations of Boolean values
* the item is a String and is convertible to a Boolean using one of the possible string representations of Boolean values

If the item is not one of the above types, or the item is a String or Integer, but is not one of the possible values convertible to a Boolean, the result is false.

Possible values for Integer, Decimal, and String are described in the toBoolean() function.

If the input collection contains multiple items, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

If the input collection is empty, the result is empty.

#### toBoolean() : Boolean

If the input collection contains a single item, this function will return a single boolean if:

* the item is a Boolean
* the item is an Integer and is convertible to a Boolean using one of the possible integer representations of Boolean values
* the item is a Decimal and is convertible to a Boolean using one of the possible decimal representation of Boolean values
* the item is a String and is convertible to a Boolean using one of the possible string representations of Boolean values

If the item is not one the above types, or the item is a String or Integer, but is not one of the possible values convertible to a Boolean, the result is empty.

If the item is a String, but the string is not convertible to a boolean (using one of the possible string representations of Boolean values), the result is empty.

The following table describes the possible values convertible to an Boolean:

| Type | Representation | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **String** | 'true'`, 't'`, 'yes'`, 'y'`, '1'`, '1.0'` | `true` |
|  | 'false'`, 'f'`, 'no'`, 'n'`, '0'`, '0.0'` | `false` |
| **Integer** | `1` | `true` |
|  | `0` | `false` |
| **Decimal** | `1.0` | `true` |
|  | `0.0` | `false` |

Note for the purposes of string representations, case is ignored (so that both 'T'` and 't'` are considered `true`).

If the input collection contains multiple items, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

If the input collection is empty, the result is empty.

If the input collection is empty, the result is empty.

If the `unit` argument is provided, it must be the string representation of a UCUM code, and is used to determine whether the input quantity can be converted to the given unit, according to the unit conversion rules specified by UCUM. If the input quantity can be converted, the result is true, otherwise, the result is false.

If the input quantity can be converted, the result is true, otherwise, the result is false.

> Note: Implementations are not required to support a complete UCUM implementation, and are free to return empty (`{ }`) when the `unit` argument is used and it is different than the input quantity unit.
