### Subsetting

#### [ index : Integer ] : collection

The indexer operation returns a collection with only the `index`-th item (0-based index). If the input collection is empty (`{ }`), or the index lies outside the boundaries of the input collection, an empty collection is returned.

> Note: Unless specified otherwise by the underlying Object Model, the first item in a collection has index 0. Note that if the underlying model specifies that a collection is 1-based (the only reasonable alternative to 0-based collections), _any collections generated from operations on the 1-based list are 0-based_.

The following example returns the 0th `name` of the Patient:

```
Patient.name[0]
```

#### single() : collection

Will return the single item in the input if there is just one item. If the input collection is empty (`{ }`), the result is empty. If there are multiple items, an error is signaled to the evaluation environment. This function is useful for ensuring that an error is returned if an assumption about cardinality is violated at run-time.

The following example returns the name of the Patient if there is one. If there are no names, an empty collection, and if there are multiple names, an error is signaled to the evaluation environment:

```
Patient.name.single()
```

#### first() : collection

Returns a collection containing only the first item in the input collection. This function is equivalent to `item[0]`, so it will return an empty collection if the input collection has no items.

#### last() : collection

Returns a collection containing only the last item in the input collection. Will return an empty collection if the input collection has no items.

#### tail() : collection

Returns a collection containing all but the first item in the input collection. Will return an empty collection if the input collection has no items, or only one item.

#### skip(num : Integer) : collection

Returns a collection containing all but the first `num` items in the input collection. Will return an empty collection if there are no items remaining after the indicated number of items have been skipped, or if the input collection is empty. If `num` is less than or equal to zero, the input collection is simply returned.

#### take(num : Integer) : collection

Returns a collection containing the first `num` items in the input collection, or less if there are less than `num` items. If num is less than or equal to 0, or if the input collection is empty (`{ }`), `take` returns an empty collection.

#### intersect(other: collection) : collection

Returns the set of elements that are in both collections. Duplicate items will be eliminated by this function. Order of items is not guaranteed to be preserved in the result of this function.

#### exclude(other: collection) : collection

Returns the set of elements that are not in the other collections. Duplicate items will not be eliminated by this function, and order will be preserved.

e.g. Patient.children().exclude(name|birthDate) would return all the properties of the Patient except for the name and birthDate.
