### Filtering and projection

#### where(criteria : expression) : collection

Returns a collection containing only those elements in the input collection for which the stated `criteria` expression evaluates to `true`. Elements for which the expression evaluates to `false` or empty (`{ }`) are not included in the result.

If the input collection is emtpy (`{ }`), the result is empty.

The following example returns the list of `telecom` elements that have a `use` element with the value of 'official'`:

```
Patient.telecom.where(use = 'official')
```

#### select(projection: expression) : collection

Evaluates the `projection` expression for each item in the input collection. The result of each evaluation is added to the output collection. If the evaluation results in a collection with multiple items, all items are added to the output collection (collections resulting from evaluation of `projection` are _flattened_). This means that if the evaluation for an element results in the empty collection (`{ }`), no element is added to the result, and that if the input collection is empty (`{ }`), the result is empty as well.

```
Bundle.entry.select(resource as Patient)
```

This example results in a collection with only the patient resources from the bundle.

```
Bundle.entry.select((resource as Patient).telecom.where(system = 'phone'))
```

This example results in a collection with all the telecom elements with system of `phone` for all the patients in the bundle.

```
Patient.name.where(use = 'usual').select(given.first() + ' ' + family)
```

#### repeat(projection: expression) : collection

A version of `select` that will repeat the `projection` and add it to the output collection, as long as the projection yields new items (as determined by the [equals](#equals) (`=`) operator).

This function can be used to traverse a tree and selecting only specific children:

```
ValueSet.expansion.repeat(contains)
```

Will repeat finding children called `contains`, until no new nodes are found.

```
Questionnaire.repeat(item)
```

Will repeat finding children called `item`, until no new nodes are found.

Note that this is slightly different from:

```
Questionnaire.descendants().select(item)
```

which would find **any** descendants called `item`, not just the ones nested inside other `item` elements.

The order of items returned by the `repeat()` function is undefined.

#### ofType(type : TypeInfo) : collection

Returns a collection that contains all items in the input collection that are of the given type or a subclass thereof. If the input collection is empty (`{ }`), the result is empty. The `type` argument is an identifier that must resolve to the name of a type in a model. For implementations with compile-time typing, this requires special-case handling when processing the argument to treat is a type specifier rather than an identifier expression:

```
Bundle.entry.resource.ofType(Patient)
```
