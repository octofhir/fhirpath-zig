### Utility functions

#### trace(name : String [, projection: Expression]) : collection

Adds a String representation of the input collection to the diagnostic log, using the parameter `name` as the name in the log. This log should be made available to the user in some appropriate fashion. Does not change the input, so returns the input collection as output.

If the `projection` argument is used, the trace would log the result of evaluating the project expression on the input, but still return the input to the trace function unchanged.

```
contained.where(criteria).trace('unmatched', id).empty()
```

The above example traces only the id elements of the result of the where.

#### Current date and time functions

The following functions return the current date and time. The timestamp that these functions use is an implementation decision, and implementations should consider providing options appropriate for their environment. In the simplest case, the local server time is used as the timestamp for these function.

To ensure deterministic evaluation, these operators should return the same value regardless of how many times they are evaluated within any given expression (i.e. now() should always return the same DateTime in a given expression, timeOfDay() should always return the same Time in a given expression, and today() should always return the same Date in a given expression.)

##### now() : DateTime

Returns the current date and time, including timezone offset.

##### timeOfDay() : Time

Returns the current time.

##### today() : Date

Returns the current date.
