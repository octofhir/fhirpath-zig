### Combining

#### union(other : collection)

Merge the two collections into a single collection, eliminating any duplicate values (using [equals](#equals) (`=`) to determine equality). Unioning an empty collection to a non-empty collection will return the non-empty collection with duplicates eliminated. There is no expectation of order in the resulting collection.

In other words, this function returns the distinct list of elements from both inputs. For example, consider two lists of integers `A: 1, 1, 2, 3` and `B: 2, 3`:

```
A union B // 1, 2, 3
A union { } // 1, 2, 3
```

This function can also be invoked using the `|` operator.

```
a.union(b)
```

is synonymous with

```
a | b
```

#### combine(other : collection) : collection

Merge the input and other collections into a single collection without eliminating duplicate values. Combining an empty collection with a non-empty collection will return the non-empty collection. There is no expectation of order in the resulting collection.
