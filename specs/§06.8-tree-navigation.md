### Tree navigation

#### children() : collection

Returns a collection with all immediate child nodes of all items in the input collection. Note that the ordering of the children is undefined and using functions like `first()` on the result may return different results on different platforms.

#### descendants() : collection

Returns a collection with all descendant nodes of all items in the input collection. The result does not include the nodes in the input collection themselves. This function is a shorthand for `repeat(children())`. Note that the ordering of the children is undefined and using functions like `first()` on the result may return different results on different platforms.

> Note: Many of these functions will result in a set of nodes of different underlying types. It may be necessary to use `ofType()` as described in the previous section to maintain type safety. See [Type safety and strict evaluation](#type-safety-and-strict-evaluation) for more information about type safe use of FHIRPath expressions.
